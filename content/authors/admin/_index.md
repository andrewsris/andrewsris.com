My name is Andrew Srisuwananukorn, and I am currently a Hematology and Oncology fellow at Mount Sinai Hospital. I am clinically interested in  Myeloproliferative Neoplasms and Hematological Malignancies, but my research interests include Machine Learning and deployment of models in the clinical setting. 

Outside of medicine, I love cooking and exploring new restaurants with my fiancé in New York City. I have a passion for music, and am trying to learn Jazz Piano.
