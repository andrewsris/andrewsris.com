Hello and thank you for reading my blog. In this space, I hope to explore concepts in Machine Learning as well as their applications within Hematology and Oncology. Please continue to watch this space, as it will continually be growing and eventually serve a hub to deploy the models I create.

Currently, I am clinically interested in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms and Hematological Malignancies in general, but my research interests include Machine Learning, big data, and multi-omics integration. 

Outside of medicine, I love cooking and exploring new restaurants with my wife (!!) in New York City. I have a passion for music, both listening and playing. I am trying to learn jazz piano right not, and it is a real struggle.
