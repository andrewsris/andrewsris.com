Welcome to my personal blog and space for experimentation and learning. Please bear with me as it is still a work in progress. My goals in this blog are to:

1. Document some of the skills that I have learned in R and Python.
2. Experiment with new modeling techniques.
3. Get feedback in regards how to get better.
4. Write better and clearly.
5. Produce pretty data visualizations.

Thanks again for stopping by, and please let me know what you think! I am always open to feedback.
